# Flask_Dep

1. Created 4 models, found Random Forest & LogisticRegression to be good based on the precision/recall/accuracy
2. Used User User recomendation over Item Item based on the lower RMSE
3. Had issues with uploading random forest pickle due to size issues
4. Hosted the app on Heroku but crashed due to memory issues (tried various methods to make the code/model lighter but could not succeed).
